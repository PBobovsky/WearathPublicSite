#customRules #public 

At character creation, each PC may choose 2 additional lores to be trained in (using standard lore rules).
Starting at level 4 and every 4 levels after they get a lore increase.
Your character can use a lore increase to either become trained in one lore in which they’re untrained or become an expert in one lore in which they’re already trained. 

If your character is at least 7th level, they can use a lore increase to become a master of a lore in which they’re already an expert. If they’re at least 15th level, they can use an increase to become legendary in a lore of which they’re already a master.
