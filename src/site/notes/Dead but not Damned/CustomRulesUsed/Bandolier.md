 Retrieving and stashing an item from and to a bandolier takes `pf2:1` interact action. 
 Each character is assumed to have a single 'bandolier'. 
 A bandolier holds up to 6 items and one set of tools which are then considered to be 'worn'. 
 A bulk X item counts as X+1 items for the purposes of bandolier. Only one bandolier can be equipped at a time.
