#customRules #public 
Out of combat healing comes passively while spending 10 minutes out of combat on non-intensive activities after a non-trivial combat encounter. 
Each character heals up their nearest threshold. Those come at each multiple of 20%. 
A character can only heal to the nearest higher threshold and cant heal further, they have to be healed by cure wounds to progress further. (ie a character at 60% can't heal to 80% on their own).
Wounded condition lowers the max threshold of this healing by one degree. (ie a character with Wounded 1 can only heal to 80%)
Wounded doesnt get automatically removed by Treat Wounds. When using Treat Wounds, a healing character has to choose whether they heal HP of the healed character or will treat the wounded condition.
To treat the wounded condition, they have to attempt a medicine check against On-level DC of the healed character.

Critical Success - Lower Wounded condition by 2
