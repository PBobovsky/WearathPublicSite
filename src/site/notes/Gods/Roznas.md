Roznas is the god of the underworld and underground in general.‌

No race truly loves Roznas, but plenty praise him to stay on his safe side.
‌
The new moon is thought of as a time when Roznas is provided vision into the world above his realm.

  
  

> _"Sometimes when you walk in the deep woods and you lose your way, stumble deeper and deeper into the forest, you will come upon a place where the darkness is so deep it could be cut with a knife and the silence... oh the deafening silence in the air could overpower you. 
> And there in the darkness like a mist and silence like a lake above you, there you might find an altar devoted to him, the lord of the underworld. Roznas."
